Scripts and docker stuff for the October 2021 Defcon 610 Pub Crawl

A 3 gate puzzle that runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero

Much of this comes from gangrif's fine work, found at https://github.com/gangrif/dc610-pubcrawl-example

I've included get-docker.sh in the repo. This was provided by Docker to install the docker bits on the Pi. It'll do the trick.
