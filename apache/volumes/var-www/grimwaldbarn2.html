<p dir="ltr">Grimwald tells you of a foul dragon, Sparky the Blue. He has captured a princess and is holding her in the keep where Grimwald once served. He claims that the princess has a magical harp that can play a song that can slay the beast. He reaches into his tunic and pulls out a small box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This has my key that will let you into the keep. Your magical nmap should help you find it. There is also a reward for you for your efforts so far&rdquo;</p>
