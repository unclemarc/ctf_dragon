<p dir="ltr">You come to a ramshackle barn. You see a balding portly man snoring on top of a pile of hay. You poke him with your sword and he startles awake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oy! That hurt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He rubs his eyes and stares at you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Aye, you look like a tough one. How would you like some adventure?&rdquo;</p>
