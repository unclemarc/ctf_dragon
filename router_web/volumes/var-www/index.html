<p>Welcome! You're getting there, but sadly, this address has nothing of actual value.</p>
<p>Well, that's not entirely true. What I can tell you is that 192.168.42.1 and 192.168.42.2 do not have any flags associated with them. Attacking or poking at these IPs is a waste of your time. And yes, that IS the kind of thing someone who doesn't want you to try to get the flags MIGHT say, but please trust me on this one.</p>
<p>Two of the three flags will require some Linux knowledge. If you're terrible with Linux, either have Google ready or maybe try another one of the locations.</p>
<p>In any case, good luck and have fun!</p>
