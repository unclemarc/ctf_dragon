<p>You arrive at the hamlet. There is a ramshackle building that has a carved sign hanging over the door that shows a rowdy looking boar holding a mug of ale. There are multiple small huts and you see various residents coming and going. A small boy sees you and smiles and waves.</p>

<p>Do you go into the <a href="/tavern.html">Brazen Boar tavern</a> or <a href="/chat_with_boy.html">chat with the small boy</a>?</p>
